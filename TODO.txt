- see how similar outputs are if i just use c70b0e7f instead (extend
  al_analysis/model_test.py?)
  (vs commit just prior, or commits after which reverted it)
  perceptible? presumably not meaningfully different?

  - restore the features added in c70b0e7f, such that they can be selectively
    re-enabled?
